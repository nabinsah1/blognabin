       <pre style="color:brown">
        i woke up at 5 am. yesterday night i slept little late around 12 pm .I started my day reading book called power of positive thinking.
        After reading for while, i went for my classes.I spended neary 2 hours in library reading and studying rules of grammar.Then at 3 pm i arrived at my room.
        Then i completed the css part of this blog and added some new features like adding a button to read the blog posts.
        I also added a new post for today.It took me more than 4 hours to complete the css part and add the button.
        However, i am happy with the result and i hope you will like it too.
        it's now 10 45 pm and i am writing this post.
        I am feeling tired but satisfied with my work today.
        I hope to continue this progress and keep improving my skills.

        Thank you for reading my blog and i hope you have a great day ahead.
