    <h3>Thoughts</h3>
    <pre style="color:black; font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 20px;">
      I started my day by doing exercise for 25 minutes. Although  i woke up at 7 am, one hour late then my alarm time,then i went for my classes.
      today there was mock test of english which was quite easy question though i was only able to score 22/27. Mam told us that you must score at least
      25. Tommorow again there is mock test .I am excited for test.i think today was the most productive day of this week as i was able to spend much 
      time studying without distraction. i am recovering from being distracted and unable to focus for longer peroid. 
      my study time 
      math - 3/4 ( i sloved only 15 question in 3 hours in that too half was wrong )
      itels -2/2 ( productive)
      grammar- 1/3 ( revised some rules )
      it was better compare to other day . 
      I am in dillema for one decison. Should i read book in local bus or not while going for classes. As i don't have much time at home.
      i feel like many will say loook he is being cool but that is what stooping me from this . i don't when i will decide about this 

      thanks for reading
