    <h3>Thoughts</h3>
    <pre style="color:black; font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 20px;">
     today was the most relaxing day. i woke up agian late then my alarm clock around 7 . i went for my class at 8 am and came back by 12 pm . 
     i finished my lunch. THen i tired to sleep for at leat 2 hours but i was not able to have good sleep . i woke up from my bed around 3 pm 
     started studying for my itels section.i was able to complete practicing of listening section and reading section of itels. Everything was 
     going normal . Then i saw the post of my freind getting certificate of Cs50 course which made me feel like i should also had completed that 
     at that time when i was wacthing that course vidoes only. i felt vey bad about my own behaviour. i talked with that optmistic freind  i felt 
     like i should also continue my studying progress related to tech and computer science. As i already mentioned that i have plan to finish my sat 
     and itels first So after finishing that while my visa process <b>i will complete that cs50 course with the problem and making new projects</b>. 
         yep this was my day. i would say it was quite productive day . Now i will not count hours while studying but i will try to complete my task 
         by taking time how much it requires to complete that task.
         my productives hours 
         itels - 2/2
         math - 3/4
            grammar - 0/3 ( today again it remains untouched )
            yeah that for today . 
            i would like to comment my own thoughts and realization that 
            <b> In life discipline and consistency make you different person what you think about yourself</b>
    Thanks for reading
