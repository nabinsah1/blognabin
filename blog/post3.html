            Today i wake up at 9 am. yep, i know it's late but today was saturday . my days are not going productive as i expecte and plan. 
            I am not able to implement the things i learn in my life. i am not able to focus on one thing and do it consistently.
            From tommorow i will try to fill all the checkbox of my daily task list of hours of focused study . 
            HERE is my sample of check box 
            <img src="\images\task.png" alt="task checkbox">
            Here is my daily task checkbox for everyday till i complete my SAT and Itels exam.
            i will be docmenting all my effective hours of study and my daily progress in this blog.
            This will help me to be accountable and consistent in my study routine.
            Let's begin this journery form the <b>date 27 july 2025</b>. 
            for today my day was not productive i just watched movie and slep for hours . i also cut my hair today So i felt good about it.
            for now i will read book then i will sleep. 
            let's see how many box i would be able to fill form tomorrow.
            ohh, now i remembered there was a quote i listened in movie 
            the quote goes like this
             <b>"someone : why do nice people choose the wrong to date?
                Answer: We accept the love we think we deserve.
            </b>
            i think this is true in my case. i always choose the wrong person to date and then i regret it later.
            So i was able to releate with this.
            Thank you for taking the time to read my thoughts today and plan for tommorow
