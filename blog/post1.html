        <h1 style="font-style: inherit;"> Thoughts </h1>
        <pre> today i watched the movie the socail network which inspired me to learn about webpages.
            i am not the guy who is good at coding or anyother skill . i like to read self help books
            and i understand the every psychology of making habit or breaking habit.Even though i read all these
            book i am not able to implement it in my life. i plan my day everymorning but at the end of the day only 20 
            percent of my plan i am able to implement. Which makes me feel frustrated and i feel like i am bad at my habits.
            Today, in book named THE ONE THING  i read that <b>"To achieve extraordinary result we should use Focus on the ONE THING 
            which will make others unecessary and unworthy."</b>
            That's the quote of the day i read today. i will try to implement it in my life.
            i would also want you to implement this statement in your life.

            Thanks for your time to read my thoughts.
            Hope you have a grear day.
            -Nabin
