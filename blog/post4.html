        New day, new beginning. Today i woke up at 6 am . i had kept my alaram at 5 am for the purpose of exercide but i was not able to wake up.
        Even though i woke up at 6 i had time to exercise but here comes my silly mind .From today my Sat class was from 8 to 9 But in my mind i 
        was thinking that it was from 7 So i was not able to do my exercise.Also i went there by 7 am then i realised that it was from 8 am.Then 
        i messaged my friend and we went to roam around the subhurban area named as JHOR. we also get surprised by that there is waterfall in that 
        temple area. We also took some photos there.Then up to 9 10 we were able to attendent for math class. As we skipped the english class.   
        around 12 pm i was able to come back home and then i had my breakfast.After that i was able to complete my daily task list of 2 hours of 
        focused study. i studied itels for 2 hours and then i fall asleep for 2 hours.There was also match of my favourite team barcelona with one club of japan.
        i watched that match and barcelona won the match by 3 goals to 1 goal. It was fun and happy to watch barca match. then i had my lunch at 7 pm. 
        then i studied for 3 hours for my Math section of sat. i was able to complete todays sheet of math section.
        And now i am writing this blog. i am happy that i was ablr to complete 50 % of my daily task list. i will try to complete the rest of the days 
        task list. 
        Math - 3/5  (hours)
        itels - 2/2
        grammar - 0/3
        among these i was not able to complete grammar section. 
        However it was a productive day compare to yesterday. i will be more disciplined and focused from tomorrow.
        
        Thank you for taking the to read my plans. 
        The quote of the days goes like this <b>"Extra ordinary results are directly determined how narrow you can make your focus"</b>
